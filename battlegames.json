The goal is to fight to the opposing team's tree, and put two uninjured empty hands around the tree for a 100 count. If a player hugging a tree is killed or otherwise stops counting, the count must be restarted when a player once again hugs the tree.<p>Players killed should go to a Nirvana for their team, which should be far enough removed from their Base Tree that it does not impede play.<p>Variations exist where each team is allowed one \"Keeper\" which can Respawn after only 25 seconds without having to return to Nirvana - however, they Keeper is not allowed to move more than 20ft from their Base Tree."

  	"description": "<br>Two teams start the game opposite one another on field. Spaced equidistantly between the teams (creating a direct line between the bases) are three Control Points. Control Points are captured by placing a free hand on them and stating “I capture this point” x5.<p>When a controlled point is touched by the opposing team, and “I capture this point” is stated once, the point becomes neutral. It is not captured by the team until all five iterations of the incant have been completed.<p>The goal is for a team to control all three points for 30 seconds. Controlling the point closest to a team’s base is typically easy, but holding the center, and then also the point closes to the enemy team becomes more and more challenging.<p>Depending on game length, the game can end when one team manages to complete the objective. Alternately, completing the objective nets a team 1 point, and the game can be played to see which team scores more points within a certain period of time.<p>In very large games, it may be necessary to have a method of breaking ties. If it is possible to have an additional Reeve of non-combatant counting time, measure the amount of time each team controls the central Control Point. If no team manages to complete the objective, the team that controls the center point should be declared the winner."
