                <h3>Charge</h3>
                <p>Some Magic and Abilities may continue to be used after their per-life or per-refresh uses are consumed.  These Magic and Abilities are denoted with the word “Charge” and a number after them. In order to gain an additional per-life or per-refresh use of a Charge Magic or Ability the Charge Incantation must be repeated in full the number of times indicated by number after Charge. For instance an Ability labeled ‘Charge x3’ requires three full repetitions of the Charge Incantation in order to be usable</p>
                <p>Unless otherwise noted:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Once an ability has been Charged, it may then be held for later use in the same game. Once it is used you may then Charge it again for another use</li>
                    <li>Any Incantation to activate a Charged ability is separate from the Charge Incantation</li>
                    <li>Charges for per-refresh Magic and Abilities carry between lives; a per-refresh Ability Charged on a previous life and not used can be used on the next life</li>
                    <li>Charged Magic and Abilities that are per life or per Refresh lose their Charge when they are replenished. Example: A Charged Ability which is ‘1/Life Charge x3’ loses it’s Charge when a player begins a new life, but may be Charged normally once the standard per-life uses have been consumed</li>
                    <li>The ability being Charged must be designated at the beginning of the Charge</li>
                    <li>You may only have one instance of a given Magic or Ability Charged at a time. Example: An Ability listed as 2/life Charge x3 may only be Charged once both per-life uses have been expended, and may only have a single instance of the Ability Charged thereafer</li>
                    <li>Only Magic and Abilities which may be Charged can benefit from Innate, Steal Life Essence, etc.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Charge Incantation</h3>
                <p>The Incantation (see Incantation for general rules about Incantations) that is used to Charge an ability. A single ‘Charge Incantation’ is repeating the following phrase:</p>
                <p><i>“Out of battle I pause to rest,<br>
                I take some time to catch my breath.<br>
                Return to me my fleeting power<br>
                To aid me in my darkest hour.”</i></p>
                <p>The Charge Incantation requires an empty hand and must be audible out to 20 feet</p>

                <p>The verbal component required by some magics and abilities that initiates their function.<br>
                Magic and Abilities used at a Range greater than Touch require that the target be indicated by name. Example: <i>“Timmy, I command thee to stop, I command thee to stop, I command thee to stop.”</i> If the name of the target is not known, or if the casting player prefers, they may instead point at the target with a free hand and name their class and a descriptor. Example: <Point with a free hand> <i>“Warrior in blue, I command thee to stop, I command thee to stop, I command thee to stop.”</i> When targeting a piece of equipment the caster must explicitly define the equipment in addition to the player most recently using it. Example: <i>“Timmy, blue sword on hip, I call upon flame to heat that sword, I call upon flame to heat that sword, I call upon  flame to heat that sword.”</i><br>

                    <li>An interrupted incantation does not result in a magic or ability being consumed. Interrupted Incantations must be restarted from the beginning</li>
                    <li>Require the caster to have an empty hand with the exception of holding Material Components or the target of a Touch Range magic</li>
                    <li>Starting an Incantation renders the player’s active Magic Balls inactive and interrupts any other Incantation or Chant the player has in progress</li>
                    <li>Meta-magic used must be stated immediately prior to beginning the incantation for the modifed magic. Abilities marked as Ambulant in the class description ignore this requirement</li>
                    <li>Require the target to be at least partially visible at the end of the Incantation to be effective. If the target is not at least partially visible the Ability or Magic is still used up</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Completing an Incantation results in an Ability or Magic being used up, regardless of if the target was valid or affected</p>

                    <li>Magic Armor never stacks with other Magic Armor and may not be worn with normal armor.

Example: A player is wearing both <a href="/spells/g#giftofearth" data-ajax="false">Gift of Earth</a> (2 points of Magic Armor) and <a href="/spells/b#barkskin" data-ajax="false">Barkskin</a> (1 point of Magic Armor). Since Gift of Earth is the highest value the Magic Armor from Barkskin is ignored. If Gift of Earth is removed the player will have a new Magic Armor maximum of 1 point. All locations greater than 1 point will be lowered to 1 point while all locations at 1 point or lower will remain unchanged</li>
                    <li>Magic Armor may be the target of magic or effects that affect armor such as Armor Breaking, Fireball, etc</li>
                    <li>Magic Armor may be repaired like any other armor</li>

                    <li>Unless otherwise noted in the description of the Enchantment, Magic Armor can never benefit from armor enhancement abilities or magics such as Blessed Armor or Imbued Armor. Example: Stoneskin is naturally considered Blessed Armor, but Barkskin can not benefit from Blessed Armor in any way</li>
                    <li>Players may wear more Magic Armor than their class maximum allows. A class which cannot wear any armor can still wear Magic Armor</li>

                <h3>School</h3>
                <p>Magic and Abilities are divided into Schools, referred to commonly as the ‘Schools of Magic’. Each School specializes in a certain genre of magic and typically the effects of the different Magic and Abilities within a School are similar</p>
                <p><b>Command:</b> Typically makes players stop moving or change their actions in some manner. Frequently makes use of the Stopped, Frozen, and Insubstantial States. All offensive magic and abilities from the Command School are Verbals. All offensive magic and abilities from the Command School have the word <i>“command”</i> in the incantation</p>
                <p><b>Death:</b> Typically causes injury or death. Frequently makes use of the Cursed and Fragile States. All offensive magic and abilities from the Death School are Verbals. Offensive magic and abilities from the Death School tend to be very explicit about the result as part of the incantation such as <i>“I call for your death”</i></p>
                <p><b>Flame:</b>Typically destroys equipment or wounds/kills players. Offensive magic and abilities from the Flame School can be either a Verbal or a Magic Ball. Magic Balls from the Flame School typically destroy equipment and wound or kill players, while Verbals from the Flame School typically target equipment and destroy it, rather than targeting players themselves. All offensive Verbals from the Flame School have the word <i>“flame”</i> in the incantation</p>
                <p><b>Neutral:</b> Has effects that alter game play for the user in some manner and does not directly affect other players</p>
                <p><b>Protection:</b> Typically enchantments that provide magical armor, Immunity to a School, or Resistance to a School or State. There are no offensive magic or abilities in the Protection School</p>
                <p><b>Sorcery:</b> Typically effects that deal with raw magical force, manipulating magic itself, or controlling the aether. Offensive magic amd abilities from the Sorcery School tend to be very explicit about the result as part of the incantation and frequently includes the word <i>“power”</i>. Offensive magic and abilities from the Sorcery School are generally Verbals</p>
                <p><b>Spirit:</b> Typically Verbals that offer healing, resurrection, or the removal of harmful States with a few Enchantments sprinkled in.</p>
                <p><b>Subdual:</b> Typically makes a player stop moving or limits their actions. Makes use of the Stopped, Frozen, Stunned, and Suppressed States. All offensive magic and abilities in the Subdual School are Magic Balls</p>

                <h3>Traits</h3>
                <p>Class Abilities that function all of the time without activation being required. Includes such things as Immunity and the ability to use extra equipment. Traits are denoted with a <i>(T)</i> and are always non-magical in nature. Traits may not be removed by any means and persist after respawn. Immunities granted by Traits persist after death. Note: Some Traits mimic other Magic or Abilities, but these Traits are still always on and ignore any Incantation or Materials requirement listed. Traits always take effect before Immunities and Resistances.</p>

                <p>Magics and Abilities that require an incantation to be activated. Verbals can have an immediate effect or impart a State or an Ongoing Effect. Ongoing Effects may have a duration, after which it expires. If a player would gain an Ongoing Effect they are already affected by, the Ongoing Effect's duration will simply be adjusted to the new duration if it is longer than the current duration. An Ongoing Effect without a duration continues until it is removed by some outside force or until a condition is met. Unless otherwise noted, all Ongoing Effects are removed when a player dies and cannot apply to dead players.</p>
