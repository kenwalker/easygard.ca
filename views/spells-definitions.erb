                <ol>
                    <li>Ability Enchantments denoted as Magical (m) in the class description count towards the bearers limit for carried Enchantments</li>
                    <li>Ability Enchantments denoted as Extraordinary (ex) in the class description do not count towards enchantment limits or count for the purposes of Attuned, Essence Graft, or similar abilities. A player may not have more than one (ex) enchantment of the same name</li>
                    <li>Abilities granted via an Enchantment retain the original School of the ability, not the School of the Enchantment</li>
                    <li>Ongoing Effects are effects applied by abilities where the effect lasts for some specified duration (Examples: Terror, Heat Weapon, and Shake it Off) or for an indefinite duration (Examples: Elemental Barrage, and Shove)</li>
                    <li>An improperly cast ability, or ability which could not have been activated, fails. For example, abilities cast while Suppressed, or Magical abilities cast without an empty hand throughout the incantation</li>
                    <li>Failed abilities have no effect on any target. A use of the ability is still expended</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Effects on a player trigger in this order: Traits, Immunities, Resistances, Other Enchantments</li>
                    <li>Other Enchantment effects trigger at the same time, even if the result of one would prevent another. Example one: A player bearing Phoenix Tears and Troll Blood dies. Both enchantments trigger and lose a strip, player is Frozen for 30s, ignores the killing effect, and when Frozen is removed all wounds are removed, etc. Example two: A player bearing Ancestral Armor and Gift of Air is hit by a normal melee weapon in an armored location. That hit location loses 1 point of armor, and the player is Insubstantial</li>

                <p>Some abilities may have their per-life or per-refresh uses restored after they are consumed. These abilities are denoted with the word “Charge” and a number after them. In order to gain an additional per-life or per-refresh use of a Chargeable ability the Charge Incantation must be repeated in full the number of times indicated by number after Charge.

                <h3>Charge Incantation</h3>
                <p>The Incantation that is used to Charge an ability. A single ‘Charge Incantation' is repeating the following phrase:</p>

                I take some time to catch my breath.<br>

                To aid me in my darkest hour.”</i></p>

                <h3>Incantation</h3>
                <p>The verbal component required by some abilities that initiates their function. Abilities used at a Range greater than Touch require that the target be indicated by name. Example: <i>“Timmy, I command thee to stop, I command thee to stop, I command thee to stop.”</i> If the name of the target is not known, or if the casting player prefers, they may instead point at the target with an empty hand and say two descriptors for the target, such as their class and the color of their tunic. Example: <Point with an empty hand> <i>“Warrior in blue, I command thee to stop...”</i> When targeting a piece of equipment, the caster must identify the equipment in addition to the player most recently using it. Example: <i>“Timmy, blue sword on hip, I call upon flame to heat that sword..."</i></p>

                    <li>Must be said loudly and clearly enough to be heard within 50' or by the recipient, whichever is closer. Incantations for abilities which target self must be audible to within 20'. In the event of a disagreement over audible range, consult a reeve</li>
                    <li>Unless otherwise noted in the ability description a player may not move their feet when incanting. If a player moves their feet the incantation is interrupted</li>
                    <li>Improper wording, mispronunciation, a gap of more than two seconds between words, or omitting words will all result in an interrupted incantation</li>
                    <li>An interrupted incantation does not result in an ability being consumed. Interrupted incantations must be restarted from the beginning</li>
                    <li>Require the caster to have an empty hand with the exception of holding Material Components or the target of a Touch or Other Range magic. Incantations listed as Extraordinary (ex) do not require an empty hand. Any hand that is touching a shield or weapon is not considered an empty hand, with the exception of hands touching a magic staff or incidentally touching Small shields that are strapped securely to the arm</li>
                    <li>Starting an incantation renders the player's active Magic Balls inactive and interrupts any other Incantation or Chant the player has in progress</li>
                    <li>The target of an ability must be at least partially visible at the completion of an Incantation. The target being out of sight at any other point does not prevent or interrupt the casting attempt. If a piece of equipment is the target, the physical equipment itself is what needs to be at least partially visible. If the incantation is completed and the target is not at least partially visible, the ability has no effect but is still expended</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Completing an incantation results in an ability being used up, regardless of if the target was valid or affected</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>If Magic Armor is granted from two different sources, only the highest value present is used and all others are ignored. Example: A player is wearing Barkskin (1 point of Magic Armor) and receives Stoneskin (2 points of Magic Armor). Since Stoneskin is higher value, their current and maximum armor values increase by 1. If the player removes Stoneskin while keeping Barkskin, their current and maximum armor values are reduced by 1

                        <li>Until all sources of Magic Armor are completely removed, Magic Armor tracks damage by hit location. Example: A player wearing Stoneskin takes a point of damage.

That hit location now has 0 points of Magic Armor out of a maximum value of 1</li>

                    <li>Players may wear more Magic Armor than their class maximum allows. A class which cannot wear any armor can still wear Magic Armor</li>
                    <li>Magic Armor behaves identically to normal armor</li>
                    <li>The presence of Magic Armor must be declared to any opponents at the beginning of an engagement if possible; Magic Armor should not result in a ‘surprise survival'</li>
                    <li>Enchantments which grant Magic Armor fail when targeting a player with worn armor. Players may not don worn armor while bearing an enchantment which grants magic armor. (If you are only wearing armor that was rated initially as zero points it may be worn with Magic Armor.)</li>

                <p>A type of ability which alters the typical behavior of other abilities</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Meta-Magic follows all the standard rules for Incantations, except for Ambulant, which may be cast while moving</li>
                    <li>Meta-Magic must be stated immediately after indicating the target and prior to beginning the incantation for the modified ability</li>
                    <li>Abilities that are labeled with a Meta-Magic in the class description are affected as per that Meta-Magic, but do not require the player to state the incantation for that Meta-Magic</li>
                    <li>Meta-Magics do not affect other Meta-Magics, but may be combined in any number so long as all restrictions are observed. Example: A player may cast an ability using Extension and Ambulant, however Extension must be stated without moving the feet as it is unaffected by Ambulant</li>
                    <li>Meta-Magics are considered expended as soon as their incantation is finished regardless of whether or not the altered ability was completed</li>
                    <li>May not be used to modify the behavior of Magic Items or abilities granted by Enchantments such as Heat Weapon from Gift of Fire</li>

An Ongoing Effect without a duration continues until it is removed by some outside force or until a condition is met.
