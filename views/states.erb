    			<h3>States Defined</h3>
    			<p>All abilities and magics (with a few exceptions) make use of a small set of common terms to explain the result they have on the player. These results are referred to as a ‘State’ or ‘States’. A player can have any number of different States simultaneously. A State may have a duration, after which it expires. If a player would gain a State they are already affected by, the State’s duration should simply be adjusted to the new duration if it is longer than the current duration. A State without a duration continues until it is removed by some outside force or until a condition is met. Unless otherwise noted, all States are removed when a player dies and cannot apply to dead players. A State conferred by a class Trait, such as Immunity to Subdual, is always on and may not be removed by respawn, death, or any other means. States imparted at the same time as a killing blow are considered to have taken effect prior to death.  If a State which prevented a player from moving expires due to its duration ending, the player it affected must declare, “No longer [State that ended]”. This must be audible out to 20 feet. If a State which prevented a player from moving expires due to its duration ending, the player it affected must declare, “No longer [State that ended]”. This must be audible out to 20 feet.<p>

    			<h3>States Made Easy</h3>
    			<p>The number and variety of Magic, Abilities, States, and Special Effects can seem overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be. Here are a few quick steps to help you learn what you need to know to play on the field with magic and abilities.</p>
				<p>Only three things can adversely affect you: Weapons, Magic Balls, and Verbals.</p>
				<p>Weapons and Magic Balls have to physically hit you or your equipment to have an effect. No hit, no effect, no problem.</p>
				<p>Engulfing Magic Balls (Iceball, etc) and weapons (Pinning Arrow, etc) can affect you by hitting your equipment or garb. Everything else has to hit your body. Engulfing isn’t terribly common.</p>
				<p>Verbal Magic and Abilities all follow the same format: They state your name, point at you, and say an incantation of three repetitions of a phrase that activates the Verbal.</p>
				<p>All offensive Verbals have very descriptive incantations. The incantation typically contains the School and the State of the Magic or Ability being used. Example: The incantation for Hold Person is “I command thee to stop” three times; The School is ‘Command’ and the State it inflicts is ‘Stopped’.</p>
				<p>No Verbal has a range greater than 50’. If you can get further away from the caster than that you won’t be affected.</p>
				<p>There are lots of Magic and Abilities, but only a few results. If you read through and understand the States Defined and Special Effects Defined sections you will understand the result of any Magic or Ability used against you in combat on the field. All offensive combat abilities (with very few exceptions) result in one of those States or Special Effects. If you don’t know what a magic or ability does by its incantation don’t worry; ask the caster to explain and they can communicate to you in just a couple of words exactly what happened using States and Special Effects.</p>
				<p>Immunities are also very simple: If the Magic or Ability targeting you is of a given School (which is always part of the incantation) and you have Immunity to that School, then the magic or ability has no effect on you. The only exception is if they are targeting equipment you are carrying instead of you yourself, but the player will have to indicate that as part of using the Magic or Ability. If you are unaffected by a Magic or Ability, you must announce it when the Magic or Ability is complete. You can also let them know before hand if you’re feeling generous</p>

    			<h3>Immune</h3>
    			<p>The bearing player or object is not affected by Magic or Abilities from a given School. Immunity granted as a Trait does not prevent players from making use of their own class Abilities. Unless otherwise noted, Immunities do not extend beyond the player or object that has them. Example: A player with Immunity to Flame can still have his armor destroyed by a Fireball. Unless otherwise noted, players with Immunities may still be targeted by Magic and Abilities of the given School. Example: A player with Immunity to Flame can still be the target of Pyrotechnics which would still destroy their equipment (as Immunities do not extend to equipment unless noted). Immunities do not interact with Enchantments worn by the player.<br>
    			<i>Example One</i>: An Anti-paladin may wear the Flameblade Enchantment.<br>
    			<i>Example Two</i>: A player with Protection From Magic still gains Stopped if Corrosive Mist is later cast on them.<br>

				<li>May be seen and heard. 6. May see and hear</li>
				<li>May Charge abilities</li>
				<li>May use Magic and Abilities on themselves if the Magic and Abilities are able to affect Insubstantial players</li>

				<b>Shield Crushing:</b> Three hits to a shield from a weapon, Magic Ball, etc. with the Shield Crushing Special Effect destroys the shield. The wearer is unharmed unless otherwise noted.
